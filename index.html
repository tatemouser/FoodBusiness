                    <br>
                    Lathan’s business plan is driven by five motivating factors: God, a
                    passion for helping people, humanity regaining human essence, and
                    family beliefs that taught him to have a good heart and for the future to be a better place.
                    <br>
                    The kitchen is his laboratoy where he spends the majority of his time with various apparatuses 
                    concocting natural sauces to enhance any meal. It could be a simple peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
                    to the most exquisite five-course feast. Simmons’ sauces transform any meal from ordinary to great 
                    and already exquisite to simply wow.

            <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
            <h3>The core of who we are is
            rooted in service and quality...
            it is the foundation from which we
            grow a relationship with our
            customers.</h3>
            <p>If you're a purist at heart, NoFuss Taco is the place for you.
                We prepare birria the original way: big steaming bowls of
                slow-cooked beef or chicken sitting in flavorful red consommé.
                The meat here is prepared to perfection, while the broth is also
                generously seasoned with hints of cumin, cinnamon, and dried chiles. The spicy of the soup is 
                definitely a surprise at first, but we like surprises just as much as we like this Michoacan-style birria
                Spritz some fresh lime on top and enjoy your caldo with some handmade corn tortillas. If you're 
                visiting Nashville in the warmer months and a bowl of hot soup sounds like a sweaty mess waiting to 
                happen, order the equally delicious birria combo that ditches the broth for a side of beans and rice. 
                But still get the tortillas, of course.
